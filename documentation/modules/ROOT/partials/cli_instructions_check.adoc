You might already have the OpenShift CLI available on your environment. You can verify it by running an `oc` command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc version
----

You should see the following (or something similar):

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Client Version: 4.6.9
Server Version: 4.6.4 <.>
Kubernetes Version: v1.19.0+9f84db3
----
<.> NOTE: you will only see the `Server Version` and `Kubernetes Version` if you are currently connected to a Kubenetes or OpenShift cluster

If you see output like the above you can skip to <<Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI,Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI>>.  

However, if the `oc` command doesn't exist or you have an older version of the OpenShift CLI (e.g. < `4.4.x`), continue following the instructions below.
