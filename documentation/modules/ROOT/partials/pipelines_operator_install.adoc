== Adding OpenShift Pipelines Support to the Cluster

Before we can use the Tekton Custom Resources, we need to install them onto our Cluster.  One way to do this is via an *Operator*

OpenShift provides a marketplace of installable software packaged as link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[Kubernetes Operators] called https://operatorhub.io[OperatorHub] .
You can add Kubernetes-native CI/CD to your cluster installing OpenShift Pipelines directly from OperatorHub embedded marketplace inside OpenShift.
