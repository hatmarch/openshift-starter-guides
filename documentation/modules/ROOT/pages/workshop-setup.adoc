== Access OpenShift Web Conole

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to perform various tasks via a browser.

The first time you access the web console, you will most likely be in the Administrator perspective. If you are also the Cluster Administrator, you will be presented with an overview of the whole Cluster status:

[#lab_guide_sync]
== Synchronize Lab Guide with Cluster

[IMPORTANT]
====

If you see the following at the top of your lab guide:

image::enter-subdomain.png[]

Then this means that your guide has not been "synchronized" with your OpenShift Cluster.  In that case, please follow the instructions below to connect the two.

image::subdomain-filled.png[role=right]

Otherwise, if you header looks something like the following, you can skip to <<Setup Command Line Interface,Setting up Command Line Interface>>
====

. While navigated to the OpenShift Web Console, go to the URL window of your browser.
. Select and copy (e.g. kbd:[CMD + c] on a Mac) everything after `https://console-openshift-console.` and before the first `/`.  This is the "cluster subdomain".  For example:
+
.The *cluster subdomain* (or `% CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%`)
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
dte-ocp46-m8lu7c-915b3b336cabec458a7c7ec2aa7c625f-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud
----
+
. Paste the *cluster subdomain* into the text entry box in the header:
+
image::pasted-cluster-subdomain.png[]
+
. If it looks correct, hit kbd:[Return] to refresh the lab guide.  The cluster subdomain should then represented in the header something like this:
+
image::subdomain-filled-2.png[]

TIP: If you see `% CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%` anywhere in your lab, it likely means the subdomain needs to be reposted to the lab guide.  If this happens, just follow the process above again.


[#command_line_interface]
== Setup Command Line Interface

OpenShift ships with a feature rich web console as well as command line tools
to provide users with a nice interface to work with applications deployed to the
platform.  The OpenShift tools are a single executable written in the Go
programming language and is available for the following operating systems:

- Microsoft Windows
- Mac OS X
- Linux

Depending on the workshop you are doing, you may already have the CLI setup for you.  Choose the tab most appropriate to your situation and follow the instructions therein.

The Open Labs based workshop has an integrated cloud terminal that you can use for running all the CLI based commands in the lab.  

. Locate the integrated cloud terminal from the link:https://developer.ibm.com/openlabs/guide/roks-ecosystem-partners/course/bring-your-own-app-lab/01.04[IBM Open Labs Dashboard^]

NOTE: If you have link:www.brew.sh[HomeBrew,window=_blank] installed you can instead install the OpenShift CLI using the `brew` command.  If you don't have homebrew, then follow the manual download and install instructions that follow the inset.

.Download and Install OpenShift CLI on Mac OS X using HomeBrew

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]

You may also want to enable CLI autocompletion (bash or zsh):
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
source <(oc completion bash)
source <(oc completion zsh)
----

To make CLI autocompletion persistent (bash or zsh) by adding a relevant line to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc completion bash > oc_bash_completion.sh
oc completion zsh > oc_zsh_completion.sh

[#connect_to_the_cluster_with_cli]
== Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI

Once your `oc` client is setup on your Workstation (or Web Client), you can now connect to your cluster using the OpenShift CLI.

From Web Console overview, go to top-right menu bar and click to the dropdown menu containing your username, then click *Copy Login Command*:

image::prerequisites_copy_login_command.png[Copy Login Command]

Click on *Display Token* and copy the command under *Login with this token*:

Example:

[source,bash]
----
oc login --token=some_token --server=https://c104-e.us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com:32208
----

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
Logged into "https://c104-e.us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com:32208" as "%USERNAME%" using the token provided.

You have access to 68 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "default".

[#working_with_proxies]
=== Working with proxies
It might happen that you're behind a corporate proxy to access the internet. In this case, you'll need to set
some additional environment variables for the oc command line to work.  Select the tab appropriate to your OS below.

include::partial$common_proxy_instructions.adoc[]

Follow previous section's instructions on how to set an Environment Variable on Windows. The variables you'll need
to set are:

CAUTION: Replace the proxy server with the one for your environment/machine.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
https_proxy=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
----

[NOTE]
====
If the proxy is secured, make sure to use the following URL pattern, replacing the contents with the
appropriate values:

export https_proxy=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/

__Special Characters__: If your password contains special characters, you must replace them with ASCII codes, for example the at sign @ must be replaced by the %40 code, e.g. p@ssword = p%40ssword.
