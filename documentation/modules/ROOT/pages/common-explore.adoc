If you have an IBM Cloud account, you can use the "Bring Your Own Application" Lab of IBM's Open Labs to complete this workshop.

NOTE: This section assumes you have an IBM Cloud Account.  If you do not have an IBM Cloud account, instructions for obtaining a _free_ IBM Cloud account (no credit card required) can be found link:https://www.ibm.com/au-en/cloud/free[here].

. Navigate to the link:https://developer.ibm.com/openlabs/openshift[IBM Open Labs page for OpenShift]
. Scroll down and click the `Launch Lab` button on the "Bring Your Own Application" Lab from the listing of labs
+
image::open-labs-starter-page.png[IBM Open Labs Starter Page]
+
. If you are not already logged in, you may be prompted to log in with your IBM Cloud account (or register for a new one)
. If you have successfully signed in and authenticated, you will see a screen like the following.  (it will take a minute or two to provision the lab)
+
image::provisioning.png[Provisioning Lab]
+
. Once the lab has been provisioned, you will be redirected to the IBM Open Labs start screen, only this time the labs should show a green tick indicating that the cluster has been provisioned
+
image::provisioned-lab.png[Provisioned Lab]
+
.IMPORTANT: Increase Cluster Lifetime
****
_Open Labs Clusters only last for *1 hour* by default._  You will likely need *2-3 hours* to complete this lab in one sitting.  Thus, it's important you follow the following instructions *up to 3* times to increase the lifetime of your cluster to a maximum of 4 hours

. Click on the increase time icon
+
image::provisioned-lab.png[Increase lifetime]
+
. When the dialog appears, click `Extend` indicating that you'd like to extend the lifetime of the cluster by 1 hour
** NOTE: 1 hour is the maximum amount of time that can be entered in the dialog
+
image::extend-lifetime-dialog.png[Increase Lifetime Dialog]
. You will get a prompt that the lab duration is being extended.  If successful you will see a popup on the upper right of the screen indicating that lab time has been successfully extended
+
image::lab-extended-success.png[Lab Lifetime Increase Success]
+
. *Repeat* this process up to 2 more times to increase the lifetime of the lab to a maximum of 4 hours 
****
+
.  Next, click on the `Launch Lab` button again.  This time you will be brought to the Bring Your Own Application to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Dashboard.  
+
image::lab-dashboard.png[Lab Dashboard]

. From the Lab Dashboard, click on the `Quick Links and Common Commands` from the menu on the left and then click on the link for the OpenShift console as indicated in the following image
+
.Link to OpenShift Console
image::dashboard-to-cluster.png[Dashboard Link to Cluster]

[#lab_guide_sync]
=== Synchronize Lab Guide with Cluster

[IMPORTANT]
====

If you see the following at the top of your lab guide:

image::enter-subdomain.png[]

Then this means that your guide has not been "synchronized" with your OpenShift Cluster.  In that case, please follow the instructions below to connect the two.

image::subdomain-filled.png[role=right]

Otherwise, if you header looks something like the following, you can skip to <<Command Line Interface,Setting up Command Line Interfaces>>
====

. While navigated to the OpenShift Console, go to the URL window of your browser.
. Select and copy (e.g. kbd:[CMD + c] on a Mac) everything after `https://console-openshift-console.` and before the first `/`.  This is the "cluster subdomain".  For example:
+
.The *cluster subdomain* (or `% CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%`)
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
dte-ocp46-m8lu7c-915b3b336cabec458a7c7ec2aa7c625f-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud
----
+
. Paste the *cluster subdomain* into the text entry box in the header:
+
image::pasted-cluster-subdomain.png[]
+
. If it looks correct, hit kbd:[Return] to refresh the lab guide.  The cluster subdomain should then represented in the header something like this:
+
image::subdomain-filled-2.png[]

TIP: If you see `% CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%` anywhere in your lab, it likely means the subdomain needs to be reposted to the lab guide.  If this happens, just follow the process above again.


[#command_line_interface]
== Command Line Interface

OpenShift ships with a feature rich web console as well as command line tools
to provide users with a nice interface to work with applications deployed to the
platform.  The OpenShift tools are a single executable written in the Go
programming language and is available for the following operating systems:

- Microsoft Windows
- Mac OS X
- Linux

You might already have the OpenShift CLI available on your environment. You can verify
it by running an `oc` command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc version
----

You should see the following (or something similar):

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Client Version: 4.6.9
Server Version: 4.6.4 <.>
Kubernetes Version: v1.19.0+9f84db3
----
<.> NOTE: you will only see the `Server Version` and `Kubernetes Version` if you are currently connected to a Kubenetes or OpenShift cluster

If you see output like the above you can skip to <<Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI,Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI>>.  

However, if the `oc` command doesn't exist or you have an older version of the OpenShift CLI (e.g. < `4.4.x`), select the tab appropriate to your OS and follow the instructions to install or update the OpenShift CLI. 

[tabs]
====
Mac OSX::
+
--
NOTE: If you have link:www.brew.sh[HomeBrew] installed you can instead install the OpenShift CLI using the `brew` command.  If you don't have homebrew, then follow the manual download and install instructions that follow the inset.

.Download and Install OpenShift CLI on Mac OS X using HomeBrew
****

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
brew install openshift-cli
----

You may also want to enable CLI autocompletion (bash or zsh):
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
source <(oc completion bash)
source <(oc completion zsh)
----

To make CLI autocompletion persistent (bash or zsh) by adding a relevant line to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc completion bash > oc_bash_completion.sh
oc completion zsh > oc_zsh_completion.sh
 
source oc_bash_completion.sh
source oc_zsh_completion.sh

The CLI for Windows is provided as a zip archive. Download and unzip the archive with a ZIP program and move the oc binary to a directory on your PATH. To check your PATH, open the Command Prompt and run:

[#connect_to_the_cluster_with_cli]
=== Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI

Once your `oc` client is setup on your Workstation, you can connect to cluster and start working also with OpenShift CLI.

From Web Console overview, go to top-right menu bar and click to the dropdown menu containing your username, then click *Copy Login Command*:

image::prerequisites_copy_login_command.png[Copy Login Command]

Click on *Display Token* and copy the command under *Login with this token*:

Example:

[source,bash]
----
oc login --token=some_token --server=https://c104-e.us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com:32208
----

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
Logged into "https://c104-e.us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com:32208" as "%USERNAME%" using the token provided.

You have access to 68 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "default".

[#working_with_proxies]
==== Working with proxies
It might happen that you're behind a corporate proxy to access the internet. In this case, you'll need to set
some additional environment variables for the oc command line to work.  Select the tab appropriate to your OS below.

include::partial$common_proxy_instructions.adoc[]
--
Linux::

--
include::partial$common_proxy_instructions.adoc[]
--
Windows::

Follow previous section's instructions on how to set an Environment Variable on Windows. The variables you'll need
to set are:

CAUTION: Replace the proxy server with the one for your environment/machine.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
https_proxy=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
----
--
====

[NOTE]
====
If the proxy is secured, make sure to use the following URL pattern, replacing the contents with the
appropriate values:

export https_proxy=http://USERNAME:PASSOWRD@proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/

__Special Characters__: If your password contains special characters, you must replace them with ASCII codes, for example the at sign @ must be replaced by the %40 code, e.g. p@ssword = p%40ssword.
