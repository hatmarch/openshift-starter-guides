_Open Labs Clusters only last for *1 hour* by default._  You will likely need *2-3 hours* to complete this lab in one sitting.  Thus, it's important you follow the following instructions *up to 3* times to increase the lifetime of your cluster to a maximum of 4 hours

. Click on the increase time icon
